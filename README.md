# Monkey Schreckenstein

This is a fun project at early stages with the goal to program the good old Schreckenstein from Peter Finzel of the good old Atari XL 8-bit machine with the [Monkey] language.
At the moment it uses the [Diddy] framework with some portions of the [fantomEngine] framework for bitmapfont rendering.
